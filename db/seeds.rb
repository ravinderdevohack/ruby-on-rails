# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Author.create([{name:"mohan"}, {name:"satyam"} ])
# Book.create([{name:"Over Thinking", author_id:1}, {name:"Over Speeding", author_id:2},])

# Assembly.create([{name:"wheel"}, {name:"brake"}, {name:"bumper"}, {name:"engine"} ])
# Part.create([{part_number:"00011"}, {part_number:"01111"}, {part_number:"12001"}, {part_number:"00210"}])
